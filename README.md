# Sizi's Mod Pack
A collection of Jokers and other stuff based off ideas tossed around with some friends for Balatro 

# This Mod Currently Includes
- 81 new Jokers with varying degrees of balance
- 13 new custom Decks to try out
- 9 new Vouchers
  
# Disclaimer:
-----------------------
This mod is compatible Talisman!

ALSO, Please turn on Pixel Smoothening because I have not finished downscaling all the assets, so please bear with me on that

Some Jokers have music that play when they are owned, so turn it on and off the setting in the mod config tabs so if you want the music to play 
when loading the mod for the first time, trying to fix that issue but somehow music doesn't play unless you do that first somehow

Here is also a quick tutorial on how to Install mods to speed up the process:
1. Install the Lovely injector here: https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector
2. Download Steamodded and add it to your %AppData%Roaming\Balatro\mods folder https://github.com/Steamodded/smods
3. Download this mod and put it inside of the mods folder from the previous step

With all that said, I hope you enjoy this mod. It took a lot of trial and error to finish, and expect more updates with content coming
within the next few months or so. And thanks to all some of my friends for providing many joker ideas, y'all rock!
